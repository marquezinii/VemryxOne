# Vemryx One telemetry + dashboard API Worker

**Deployed** at `https://fivemcleaner-telemetry.felipemarquesini10.workers.dev`.

This is the Cloudflare Worker + D1 backend for the anonymous telemetry
pipeline described in [`docs/telemetry.md`](../../docs/telemetry.md) and the
bug-report pipeline described in
[`docs/bug-reports.md`](../../docs/bug-reports.md), plus the authenticated
stats/bugs API the [dashboard](../dashboard/README.md) reads from.
FormSubmit has been fully removed from the .NET client for both telemetry
and bug reports — this Worker is the only transport for both.

Both `/telemetry` and `/bugs` are **live and deployed**. Bug reports are
text-only — no attachment/screenshot support, no R2 dependency. That
feature was dropped after R2 turned out to require an account-level
activation in the Cloudflare Dashboard (accepting R2's terms, possibly
confirming billing even on the free tier) that couldn't be done from this
environment; rather than block on that, the report form stayed D1-only
(category, summary, description, app version, profile, optional technical
summary, optional email, optional plain-text log excerpt capped at 100 KB).

## What's here

- `wrangler.toml` — Worker config. A single deployed instance (the
  top-level, unnamed environment — `wrangler deploy` with no `--env`)
  handles both Development- and Production-tagged telemetry; the
  `environment` column on each row is what separates them for the
  dashboard's filters, not a second deployment. (An earlier
  `env.development`/`env.production` named-environment design was removed:
  it added no benefit since D1 already distinguishes rows by that column.)
- `schema.sql` — the D1 tables: `telemetry_events` (one row per optimization
  run, including the version-2-consent hardware profile), 
  `telemetry_event_actions` (one row per applied action ID, for "most used
  function"), `login_attempts` and `admin_sessions` (custom dashboard auth).
  Applied to the real database already.
- `migrations/` — incremental changes for the already deployed D1 database.
  The account migration adds a unique username plus the accepted terms version
  and timestamp. `schema.sql` remains the complete snapshot for a new local
  database.
- `src/validateEvent.js` — pure, dependency-free validation of one event or a
  batch. The Worker never trusts client-side validation alone; every field is
  re-checked against the same allowlist server-side.
- `src/index.js` — routes: `POST /telemetry` (ingest), `POST /admin/login` /
  `POST /admin/logout`, `GET /api/stats/:name[.csv]` (protected), plus CORS
  handling (`src/cors.js`) for every response since the dashboard is served
  from a different origin than this Worker.
- `src/liveAlert/` — the single-row admin broadcast the dashboard writes
  (`POST /admin/live-alert`, session-protected) and the desktop app polls at
  startup plus once an hour (`GET /live-alert`, public, rate limited). See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-live-alerts-design.md`.
- `src/auth/` — the custom admin authentication (see below).
- `src/stats/` — `queries.js` (pure SQL+params builders, one per dashboard
  chart) and `csv.js` (pure CSV serialization for the export feature).
  Available `:name` values: `runs-per-day`, `os-versions`, `app-versions`,
  `top-cpu`, `top-gpu`, `ram-buckets`, `average-time`, `success-rate`,
  `error-categories`, `errors-by-version`, `recent-failures`. Every
  one accepts `?from=&to=&version=&environment=` query filters (`environment`
  defaults to `Production`; pass `All` to look across both).
- `test/` — unit tests for everything pure-logic above, run with Node's
  built-in test runner (no Miniflare/wrangler required):

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Admin dashboard authentication

Per an explicit decision (no external domain, no Cloudflare Access, no
Google/GitHub OAuth — the dashboard is served from a plain `*.pages.dev`
URL), authentication is a small, self-contained system:

- **Password**: never stored in code or in `wrangler.toml`. Run
  `npm run hash-admin-password` locally, which prompts for a password and
  prints a self-contained `pbkdf2$<iterations>$<salt>$<hash>` string
  (PBKDF2-SHA256 via the Workers-native `crypto.subtle` — no third-party
  crypto dependency). **100,000 iterations**, not the OWASP-recommended
  210,000: the Workers runtime (BoringSSL, not Node's OpenSSL) hard-caps
  PBKDF2 at 100,000 and throws `NotSupportedError` above that — found only
  once actually deployed, since Node itself has no such cap and the test
  suite runs under Node. 100,000 remains an accepted OWASP baseline for
  PBKDF2-SHA256. That hash string, and only that string, becomes the
  `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` Worker secret (`wrangler secret put
  ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`). The plaintext password is never written to disk,
  committed, or logged.
- **Brute-force protection**: `login_attempts` tracks failed logins per
  HMAC'd IP (`src/auth/bruteForceGuard.js`, keyed by the `IP_HASH_SECRET`
  Worker secret — the real IP itself is never stored). Five failed attempts
  within 15 minutes locks that IP out for 15 minutes; the counter resets once
  the window passes.
- **Sessions**: server-side, revocable (`admin_sessions`, `src/auth/
  sessionStore.js`) — a random 256-bit session ID is the *only* thing stored
  in the browser cookie (`__Host-`, `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None`), so logout
  or manually clearing the table actually invalidates it immediately, unlike
  a stateless signed token that can only be waited out. `SameSite=None`
  (not `Strict`/`Lax`) is required because the dashboard (`*.pages.dev`) and
  this Worker (`*.workers.dev`) are genuinely different registrable
  domains — a stricter policy silently never sends the cookie back on a
  cross-site `fetch`, which is exactly what made the first deployment's
  login appear to succeed but leave the dashboard stuck on the login screen.
- **CSRF e limites de entrada**: a publicação do alerta exige o `Origin`
  exato de `DASHBOARD_ORIGIN`, o cabeçalho `X-Vemryx-Csrf-Token` e
  `Content-Type: application/json` exato. O token é derivado no Worker da
  sessão e de `ADMIN_CSRF_SECRET`, fica somente em memória no dashboard e é
  recuperado em `GET /admin/csrf` após um recarregamento. Todos os JSON
  continuam limitados por rota antes do parse.
- **Swappable by design**: `src/auth/passwordAuthProvider.js` exposes exactly
  three functions — `login`, `logout`, `requireSession` — and `index.js` only
  ever calls those three. A future OAuth-based provider (Google/GitHub, or
  Cloudflare Access) only needs to implement the same three functions with
  the same signatures; no route or stats-endpoint code would need to change.

**Known test gap**: the pure decision logic behind each of these
(`crypto.js`, `bruteForceGuard.js`, `sessionStore.js`, `stats/queries.js`,
`stats/csv.js`, `cors.js`) is unit tested. The D1-touching glue in
`passwordAuthProvider.js` and the D1-backed routing in `index.js` are not
covered end-to-end by an automated test — that would require Miniflare (a
simulated Workers/D1 runtime), which was not set up in this environment. The
origin gate and bounded request reader are covered without D1. The rest was
validated manually against the real deployment (see "Verified end-to-end" below); two
real bugs (the PBKDF2 iteration cap and the `SameSite` cookie policy) were
only caught that way, not by the unit tests, which is exactly why this gap
is called out rather than assumed harmless.

## Product accounts

The desktop application uses Firebase Authentication directly through its
official REST API. This Worker does not receive account passwords or refresh
tokens. Future account-specific routes must accept a Firebase ID token over
HTTPS as `Authorization: Bearer <idToken>`, verify it with
`src/auth/firebaseIdToken.js` (`requireFirebaseUser` /
`verifyFirebaseIdToken`), and use only the Firebase UID (`sub`) as the
permanent internal identifier — never email.

Verification is fail-closed: RS256 only, Google JWKS
(`securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com`), required claims
`aud = fivemcleaner-app`,
`iss = https://securetoken.google.com/fivemcleaner-app`, unexpired `exp`, and
non-empty `sub`. Invalid tokens produce a generic HTTP 401
`{ "error": "unauthorized" }` with no claim detail. The pure verifier is unit
tested.

`POST /account/profile` is the first route built on it: Firebase manages
email/password/uid only, so this route stores the fields it doesn't —
username (globally unique, case-insensitive), first name, last name and the
accepted current terms version — in `account_profiles`, keyed by the verified
Firebase UID. It accepts only an `email_verified=true` token. A username
conflict returns `409 { "error": "username-taken" }`; the client is expected
to let the user pick another one without discarding the Firebase account
already created. `DELETE /account/profile` removes only that same verified
UID's row as part of account deletion. See `src/auth/accountProfile.js`.

`GET /account/username-available?u=<name>` answers `{ "available": true|false }`
for the registration form, so a taken name is reported while the user types
instead of only after the Firebase account already exists. It is the one
D1-backed route with no authentication — it necessarily runs *before* the
account does — so three things bound it:

- a per-IP `[[ratelimits]]` binding (`USERNAME_LOOKUP_LIMITER`, 20 requests
  per 60s, declared in `wrangler.toml`; see `src/rateLimit.js`). The binding
  is optional at runtime: `wrangler dev` and `node --test` run without it and
  the route stays open, which is the right trade for a read-only probe;
- the same `USERNAME_PATTERN` the insert uses, so a malformed name is
  rejected with `400 { "error": "invalid-username" }` without reaching D1;
- a bare boolean answer — never who holds a name, never anything else about
  that account.

It is deliberately **advisory**. The UNIQUE index on `account_profiles`
remains the only arbiter, a name can be claimed between the probe and the
registration, and `POST /account/profile` still returns 409. The desktop
client treats a rate-limited, failed or unreadable answer as "unknown" and
never as "available".

The public write routes use separate required `[[ratelimits]]` bindings:
`TELEMETRY_LIMITER`, `BUG_REPORT_LIMITER`, and `UPDATER_EVENT_LIMITER`. Unlike
the advisory username lookup, those routes fail closed when a binding is
missing or unavailable so a deployment mistake cannot silently expose D1 to
unbounded writes. Local handler tests must provide an explicit limiter stub
when they exercise one of those routes.

`GET /live-alert` follows the same advisory, fail-open trade as the username
lookup (`LIVE_ALERT_LIMITER`, 30/60s per IP) — it is read-only, unauthenticated
by necessity (every installed app reads it), and never exposes anything more
sensitive than the one message an admin chose to broadcast.

Legacy Worker product tables (`user_accounts` / sessions), if still present on
remote D1 from the pre-Firebase system, are not migrated. There are no real
users to preserve; cleanup is a separate authorized deploy/migration task.

## Verified end-to-end

Confirmed against the real, deployed Worker + dashboard: sent a test
telemetry event via `curl`, logged in through the actual browser at
`https://fivemcleaner-dashboard.pages.dev`, and saw the event reflected in
the tiles and charts (then deleted that test row from the real database —
no test data was left behind).

## Deploying and rotating secrets

```bash
npm install
npm run db:bootstrap:local        # creates a fresh local database from schema.sql
npm run db:migrate:local          # applies pending migrations to an existing local database

npm run hash-admin-password       # prints the ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH value
wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
wrangler secret put IP_HASH_SECRET   # any long random string
wrangler secret put ADMIN_CSRF_SECRET # distinct long random string

wrangler d1 migrations apply fivemcleaner-telemetry --remote   # touches the real database — ask first
wrangler deploy   # touches Cloudflare — ask first
```

`RELEASE_MANIFEST_JSON` is the complete signed stable update manifest served by
`GET /update/manifest`. The official stable-release workflow validates the
manifest against the embedded public key and publishes it automatically with
`wrangler secret put RELEASE_MANIFEST_JSON` immediately before deploying this
Worker. Do not hand-author, truncate, or commit that value. A manual repair is
part of the authorized release procedure only and must pipe the generated
`release/Vemryx One-signed-update-manifest.json` file unchanged into the same
Wrangler command. Preview releases do not update this stable feed.

The real deployment uses plain `wrangler deploy`/`npm run deploy` with no
`--env` — the old `deploy:development`/`deploy:production` scripts targeted
named-environment sections that have been removed.
